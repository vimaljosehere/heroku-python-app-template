# Deploy a simple Plotly Dash app on Heroku

* Finished app on [Heroku](https://flying-dog.herokuapp.com/).
* [Medium post about deploying Dash apps](https://medium.com/@austinlasseter/how-to-deploy-a-simple-plotly-dash-app-to-heroku-622a2216eb73).
* I also have a gallery of simple Dash apps for learning [here](https://github.com/austinlasseter/plotly_dash_tutorial/blob/master/06%20Heroku%20examples/list%20of%20resources.md).
* The `assets` folder contains a file called `favicon.ico` -- you can find and download customized favicons [here](https://www.favicon.cc/). Just replace the current favicon with a new one.
* Plotly Dash apps can only be viewed in a modern browser (like Chrome or Mozilla). They won't render in antediluvian browsers such as Microsoft.
